# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This is my finished project for the Calender Website. This creates a web application that allows you to plan your day! Using the Day.js library, this app automatically
updates the time and day to allow you to plan your schedule. As time progresses the css elements on the page change so that you can keep track of where you are at in 
your day. Users have the option to add notes in the calender and save them to local storage so that if the page is refreshed or closed out, their information is still
saved. I have also added an option for whoever grades this in the javascript section that you can un-comment and change the time as desired so that the page may be checked for functionality.

## Your Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am&ndash;5pm) by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Day.js in the browser.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours of 9am&ndash;5pm
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
